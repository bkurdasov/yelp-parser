I need to scrape 1 page deep off a list of base URLs that I can provide when we agree to terms.

Example of a page you'd be scraping for data: http://www.yelp.com/biz/tim-gullicksen-san-francisco-2

The columns I need from that page:
1) Name (e.g. Tim Gullicksen)
2) Group (e.g. Real Estate Agents)
3) Address (e.g. Zephyr Real Estate 2523 California St)
4) City (e.g. San Francisco)
5) State (e.g. CA)
6) Zip (e.g. 94115)
7) Neighborhood (e.g. Pacific Heights, Lower Pacific Heights)
8) Phone (e.g. 415 370-5277)
9) Website (e.g. timgullicksen.com)
